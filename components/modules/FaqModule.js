                our products to our packaging to our website. We do our homework and find vendors and materials
                that align with the company’s values to ensure that we can live up to our <b>GROWN IN THE USA</b> standards.
                Our goal is to maintain complete transparency and control over our supply chain with fair

                printed here in the USA. Even our packages are made from 100% recyclable materials, so we encourage
                you to help us in our efforts by recycling or reusing your packages when you receive some fresh new
                gear from us.</>,

                passion for skateboard culture, offering a platform to share in a collective journey towards a common goal
                of sustainability. With support from each other we can maintain the physical and mental well being and clarity

                blockchain-authentication with physical product sales.</>,
                <>After our first SZN drop, we will sell our products linked to authenticated NFTs for potential
                collectors, investors, and VoT Enthusiasts. NFTs are just one amazing example of what Web 3.0 has to
                offer and will play a major role in the next phase of the decentralized web.</>,
                <>They are gaining tremendous support from buyers and sellers alike since blockchain technology now
                allows for creators to publish digital works that are uniquely identifiable, have verified ownership,
                and are created to be scarce in order to hold value just like any other physical collectible. By
                combining this technology with each product we sell, collector value of each item is increased with
                authentication in the form of unique digital art.</>,
                <>VoT has a team of designers and programmers that are working together to bring our Village of
                Thousands to life. We're giving as much attention, customization, and care to our digital brand
                as we are with our physical product line. Our NFTs will be programatically genrated works of
                varying pieces of digital art. We are currently writing code and making art for some really
                exciting projects with endless creation possibilities that we cannot wait to share!</>,

                <>DApps are, simply put, the future of websites and how customers form and build a relationship with
                brands. They offer the security and privacy of the blockchain network while using transparent
                technologies that are strong barriers to accessing your sensitive data from being collected by
                large, centralized corporations.</>,
                <>The State of the DApps, a curated list of over 1320 decentralized apps, defines decentralized
                apps as "...applications which run on a P2P network of computers, instead of one computer. They
                are considered to be a form of software program designed to function on the internet without being
                controlled by a single entity. DApps can have front-end code and user interfaces written in any
                language, just like a traditional application, which can make calls to its backend."</>

                <>Our developers and designers are working together to prepare for a full Web 3.0 release in 2022.
                This means that all of our online services will be built on blockchain and using cryptocurrency for
                all online purchases. We realize that our world is still catching up to Web 3.0 so we will be
                offering our products for purchase with credit and debit cards through Stripe and we will make
                announcements with plenty of time for our VoT Enthusiasts to download the tools and get non-custodial
                wallets to participate in the exciting opportunity and ever-changing landscape Web 3.0 provides.</>,
                <>We will be continually upgrading and updating the website as well as hand selecting any other additional
                web services and choosing the ones that are most in alignment with our ethos. This site is built by
                by our developers, line-by-line, in order to provide a sustainable decentralized platform for the
                future of our brand. This takes a bit more work than click-and-drag websites, but we are able to
                carefully select every service we use and organically grow with Web 3.0 without restriction.</>,
                <>Village of Thousands also has our very own, <a className='link underline'

                rel="noreferrer">ERC-20</a> token, VOT, ready for distribution in 2022 alongside our full Web 3.0
                release. If you’d like to be able to trade, purchase, and invest in our token when it has been
                released then make sure you have an account with a non-custodial wallet service, such
                as <a className='link underline' href='https://metamask.io/download' target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">MetaMask</a>, stored on a Web 3.0 integrated browser, such

                and will be airdropping rewards as VOT token and limited runs of NFTs.</>,
                <>We have already set up our website to store your wallet address for quick, easy, and secure
                checkout using “browser injection”. Injection uses your in-browser wallet in order to verify that we
                have a correct address to send and receive assets so that you don’t need to worry about incorrectly
                inputting in an invalid address.</>,
                <>One of the biggest barriers for some people with sending and
                receiving crypto is that if the wallet address you send to does not match the address of the
                receiving wallet then the cryptocurrency or other digital crypto asset being sent may become
                permanently irretrievable. We have eliminated this issue with using injection so if you wish to make
                purchases on our website and receive crypto rewards in the future then please follow the procedures
                outlined in the next section regarding the tools and services needed for any Web 3.0 site.</>,

        {
            "question": "What services and tools will I need to prepare myself for Web 3.0?",
            "answer": [
                <>There are a few apps you will need to download to be ready for Web 3.0 changes across the whole
                internet. Before you get started though, the first tools you need are a pen and paper.</>,
                <>Most Web 3.0 services use a BIP39 Mnemonic Code which is a series of words unique to your account
                which you <u>MUST NOT LOSE</u> or you will lose your entire account and all assets associated with it if
                you happen to lose your password and do not have the mnemonic available for recovery.</>,
                <>Security is the top priority of blockchain services so be sure to document every account you make
                and save that information in a safe place. Thanks to emerging Web 3.0 tech there is virtually no way to hack
                into your accounts without the password and/or mnemonic so I’d say this is a fair tradeoff. While it
                may not be required to write the info on pen and paper, this method is the only sure way to have
                complete control over your security since the only way to access your wallet is with the mnemonic
                "seed phrase" and/or password and storing it on your device opens you up to the possibility of
                data being exposed.</>,
                <>Some services also authorize access with digital identity apps instead of or alongside the mnemonic
                as well. <a className='link underline' href='https://global.id/' target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">GlobaliD</a> is the most commonly used service for this so we highly recommend you
                download and set up GlobaliD on your mobile device before proceeding to the next steps, though this
                step is optional unless one of the services you choose requires it.</>,
                <>Next, you will need to get a Web 3.0 browser. The browser we recommend, for a multitude of reasons,
                is <a className='link underline' href='https://brave.com/' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Brave
                Browser</a>. It has several built in integrations with different wallets to make it easy to gain
                rewards and support Web 3.0 brands like ours. If you are comfortable with Firefox or Chrome, Brave
                will be an easy switch and we doubt you will even look back after making the switch. It is capable
                of installing Google Chrome Extensions and built for privacy. Instead of seeing ads everywhere on
                websites, you can choose to view Brave sponsored ads which will pop up on occasion and you will
                earn rewards in their native BAT token which has steadily been gaining traction and attention.
                Brave is the leading Web 3.0 browser for a good reason and we hope you will look into it and
                give it a try so you can see why.</>,
                <>Brave is available for <a className='link underline' href='https://brave.com/download/'
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">download</a> on computers and mobile devices and allows for
                syncing between them.</>,
                <>Finally, you will need a non-custodial wallet. The most popular choice is <a
                className='link underline' href='https://metamask.io/' target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">MetaMask</a>. This is where your pen and paper are absolutely needed because
                you will be instructed to write down your mnemonic. It can be useful to have a couple backups
                of your account info but if you choose to save the info digitally we recommend that you store it
                locally and/or separately on an external flash drive as a screenshot or in a text file.</>,
                <>MetaMask is a Web 3.0 account manager in a browser extension which, as Brave Browser’s website
                states, provides a “bridge to explore and handle decentralized applications (DApps) from a web
                browser.”</>,
                <><a className='link underline' href='https://metamask.io/download' target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">Download MetaMask</a> and follow all instructions carefully while documenting all
                important information. Choose a secure password. We recommend that you choose a password that is
                unique to all of your other passwords. The extra effort to do this right from the beginning will
                be well worth your time.</>,
                <>Finally, <a className='link underline'
                href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en'
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">install the Chrome Extension for MetaMask</a> on your computer
                and enter your Secret Recovery Phrase given to you on signup of MetaMask.</>,
                <>That’s the basic setup. There are many options to consider but this is the method we recommend
                for ease of use. Coinbase Wallet is another non-custodial wallet that will be capable of purchasing
                and storing NFTs in 2022 as well so if you already have Coinbase then by all means use Coinbase
                Wallet. Just make sure that whatever wallet you choose is able to be read from browser injection
                so it must be available as a browser extension.</>
